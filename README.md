#  Problematic
### Logistic Issues:
Many Moroccans want to donate to charity and non-profits and help the community, but they usually don't know where to find legitimate and reputable NGOs, or they don't know where to give their items (especially young Moroccans).



### Unorganized Charity:
People list items they want to give to charity in local Facebook groups or other social media platforms, which makes giving to charity an unorganized and tedious process: nobody really knows if a listing is still available, which results in the donor getting spammed by everyone wanting to know about the items.

### Legitimacy of Non-profit Organizations:
People always wonder if their donations really have an impact on the community, they tend to question the legitimacy of the NGOs they give their items to.

#  The Vision (The Fix)
What we can do is build an app that will connect verified NGOs (with official documents) and donors: donors will be able to donate their items to charity and be 100% sure it has an impact; NGOs on the other hand will be able to find items to gather much more easily and contact sellers on the go. In other words, the app is going to act as a the moroccan marketplace for charity.

#  My Motivation
Looking back, I've always wondered how NGOs coordinate and get access to donations with such a messy unorganized system. As someone who really likes to help everyone around me, I figured why can't I find a solution to this problem? After all, I already have some skills I could use to do good instead of just wasting my time on silly projects in my room: that's when I decided to build this app.

#  Initial Goals
### MVP Goals:
- [ ] Working sign up and log in functionality for donors and NGOs
- [ ] Donors can create a new listing with all the necessary information.
- [ ] Donors can change the state of one of their listings from their dashboard.
- [ ] Donors can report NGOs and NGOs can report donors. (auto-moderation)
- [ ] NGOs can see the listings on the feedpage and view the details.
- [ ] NGOs can bookmark listings and see them on their dashboard
- [ ] Correctly manage the state of the different listings to avoid having unavailable listing marked as active.
